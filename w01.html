        <h1> Notes From Week 01</h1>
    </header>
    <main class="container">
        <h2>Mater Mobile UX Video</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>Most people use mobile devices such as phones and tables. We should consider creating the mobile and table version before the desktop view. I used to do it the opposite way but after watching this video I will try to use this technique.</li>
        <li>Not using only, the responsive tool start with the mobile first, keep in mind the experience of the user on their phones.</li>
        <li>Speed Matters</li>
        <li>SVG are lower bandwidth, optimize CSS and js files – give people what they want fast and easy.</li>
        <li>Placement matter, we should make sure that all options are accessible to user (reachable to their fingers, icons that they understand, etc.)</li>
        <li>Stop using Pop ups / Pop-Overs, User don’t go to a website looking for ads.</li>
    </ul><hr><br><br>
<br>
<h2>Ch12: Object  Oriented Programming in JavaScript Completed</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Learning the syntax to create object and declare new ones.</li>
    <li>Constructor inside the object seems to be like the base class from python</li>
    <li>Most of things that I learned from this reading was the syntaxes for JavaScript</li>
    <li>Mixing a way to combine or in other words use the properties of an existing object</li>
</ul><hr><br><br>

<h2>Object Methods, “this” Completed</h2> 
<p>-Functionality of the word “This” inside objects and methods. <br>
    - “this” allows you to set a value without getting error in the future, it will take a different value every time it depends on how you call it.<br>
    - “this” is defined at a run time.</p><hr><br><br>


<h2>CH15: Modern JavaScript Completed</h2>

<p>-Import and exporting files in JavaScript</p>
<p>-Modules is a way to organize your code and make it reusable for other parts of the program o even other projects.</p>
<p>- I feel like I need to learn how to use the console, command line more. </p>
<h3>Questions </h3>
<p>Are we going to learn react in this course or in another one, is it something that we have to learn on our own? <br>
    Do you have an alternate video where I can learn more about searching for packages?</p>
