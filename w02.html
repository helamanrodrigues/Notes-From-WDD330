        <h2>Ch 9: The Window Object Completed</h2><br>

        <p>-The WINDOW is like the universe that involves all of the functions, classes, etc. we can access to it for example:</p>
        <p>X = 6</p>
        <p>Print(x)</p>
        <p>Print(window.x) (The result will be 6)</p>
        <p>-Window is like the main object and all of the other things are it properties.</p>
        <p>-Windows is used to for the pop ups messages. </p>
        <p>-The window object can give you pretty much all the information about the browser: host name, host, URL , href, etc.</p>
        <p>-Window.Open can open a new window, you can even set the dimensions for it for example: </p>
        <p>const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');</p><br>

        <h3>Screen Information </h3>
        <p>-It is possible to get the information from the screen where the web page or application is on.</p>
        <p>Some of the properties that we can get are height, width, available height, available width, and color depth.</p><hr>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>-Are the responsible that keep track of the user choices. The purpose is get information to narrow your search and information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p></p>-In my opinion one of the best features of using window is for the animations, I think they make the website more dynamic and friendly. I will try to use it more often.</p>

        <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
          <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
          <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
          <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable</li>
          <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
          <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
          <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
          <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
          <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
          <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
          <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
          <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.</li>
          <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Question: In what cases it is better to do animations on JavaScript instead of CSS ? </h3>
        <br><br>
        <h2>MDN the Content Template Element Completed</h2><br>
        <p>-The template element is basically use to create tables that are going to be show or loaded in a certain time. They will appear once the user loads the page we could say that is use to load the page dynamically. </p>
        <p>-It works with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>-The Template element only has global attributes</p>
